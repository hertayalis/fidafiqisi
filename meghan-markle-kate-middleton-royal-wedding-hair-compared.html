Just a few days before, she was spotted wearing her hair half-up, leading to speculation that she might copy her sister-in-law Kate Middleton and wear the style for her wedding. By now we all know the answer—Markle tapped celebrity hairstylist Serge Normant to create the coiled bun with center-parted layers tucked behind her ears.</p><img alt="Hair, Beauty, Headpiece, Tiara, Hairstyle, Tradition, Hair accessory, Fashion, Headgear, Dress, " title="Hair, Beauty, Headpiece, Tiara, Hairstyle, Tradition, Hair accessory, Fashion, Headgear, Dress, " width=1086 height=1369 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-462718825-1526757373.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-esp0ot e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><span data-node-id=4></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Royal brides have historically worn their hair down—at least partially. Middleton famously wore her hair in a half-up style for her 2011 wedding to Prince William. The loose waves pinned back by her ears was the perfect style for the deep neckline of her custom Alexander McQueen dress. For the reception, Middleton let her hair down into her signature voluminous and bouncy blowout.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Middleton's hairstyles haven't changed much over the last seven years—other than that time she cut her hair a few inches and had bangs for a few months. Middleton loves a glossy wave and blowout, rolled updo, and half-up pinned style.</p><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><img alt="Beauty, Lip, Hat, Headgear, Dress, Gesture, Fashion accessory, Smile, Photography, Finger, " title="Beauty, Lip, Hat, Headgear, Dress, Gesture, Fashion accessory, Smile, Photography, Finger, " width=789 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-960088648-1-1526740326.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-esp0ot e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Markle's hair has been the talk of the town—or, world—since she announced her engagement to Prince Harry last year. Her love for messy buns, tendrils, and flyaways has sparked a debate about royal protocol and what it means to be modern royalty. Markle also loves to wear her hair down in sleek and glossy bends or beachy California-girl waves. At the royal wedding ceremony in the morning, Markle tapped hairstylist Serge Normant to create a low, twisted bun with center-parted face-framing layers tucked behind her ears. The style still had Markle's messy appeal (the layers untucked themselves during the ceremony) but was an upgraded, formal version of her favorite twisted chignon.</p><img alt="Motor vehicle, Vehicle, Car, Luxury vehicle, Automotive design, Family car, City car, Mid-size car, " title="Motor vehicle, Vehicle, Car, Luxury vehicle, Automotive design, Family car, City car, Mid-size car, " width=3851 height=2618 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-meghan-markle-wedding-gown3-1526756826.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-esp0ot e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For the reception, Markle changed hairstylists to George Northwood, who works with celebrities like Alexa Chung and Alicia Vikander. Northwood gave Markle what she's most comfortable in (and you could tell): a tight bun secured a few inches above the nape of her neck. Her face-framing tendrils were left loose and curled. The new style was the perfect canvas for Markle's shoulders and the halter neckline of her custom Stella McCartney dress.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-9jelqa e1jtuqk13">The Duchess of Cambridge's Beauty Evolution Through The Years</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt="this image is not available" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a5b794e4-ba0e-4527-9e9d-e98142b9fbef_1526586861.jpg alt="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" title="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Jenna Rosenstein is the Beauty Director at Harper's BAZAAR across both print and digital. While attending NYU, she held internships at Women’s Wear Daily, Bloomingdale’s, Harper’s BAZAAR, and Allure, the latter of which she parlayed into her first job as the Beauty Assistant. She left Allure three years later as the Senior Beauty Editor. She spent a few months at Refinery29 overseeing branded content in the same title, before finally landing back at BAZAAR to manage all beauty content. When she's not testing every lipstick known to mankind, getting zapped by new lasers, or interviewing experts and celebrities, you can find Rosenstein at home in New Jersey with her son, husband, and black cat named Maddie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX6GutbHSrWaaamBmfniClG1mpp2Xna6vecyaqaSklWK4osDEZqSinJShsrW7zWapqLGRoXq4scOdoKefXZ2uqr6MnKamqJGnsqV7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
