According to <a href=#>E! News</a>, the couple has named their son Charlie Ralph. How adorable?</p><p>Fans immediately took to the comments to extend their well wishes to the couple. “Congratulations to you, Kelli, and the new big brother!” one wrote. Another added, “Congratulations! Many many blessings to you guys!”</p><p>Kelli and Lawrence married in 2015 and are already parents to a two-year-old son named Ludo, who was&nbsp;<a href=# rel=dofollow>born shortly after their wedding&nbsp;</a>in October 2016.</p><p>During Kelli’s first pregnancy with Ludo, they incorporated the fact that she was expecting into her storyline on SVU. “I looked up when I first got pregnant what other TV shows did and… I guess on&nbsp;The X-Files, she went away. She got abducted by aliens,” Kelli joked at the time. “So I was like, ‘That can’t happen on&nbsp;SVU.&nbsp;Can’t pitch that idea.'”</p><p>Fans of Kelli’s were speculative that baby No. 2 was on the way after seeing her co-star Mariska Hargitay’s <a href=#>snapshot of her huge baby bump</a>&nbsp;last week. In that past, Kelli has gushed that Mariska has given her motherhood tips on occasion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Kelly-Giddish-Birth-01.jpg><p>“Mariska’s given me advice and I sit and take it because, you know, she’s got a great family and she [creates] a great family for us at&nbsp;SVU,” she once shared with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="dofollow noopener">Entertainment Tonight</a>&nbsp;of the mom-of-three. “If it weren’t for her setting that tone, it would be a much much different place to work.”</p><p>Congratulations to the happy family on their newest bundle of joy!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46lmLBln6expr6MrK2uZaOprrN5yp6jpaFdnLalsMisn2avlaGwsLnErGSsnZOku6V5wZqZsmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
