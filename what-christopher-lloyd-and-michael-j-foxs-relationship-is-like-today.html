Fox was not the first pick</a> for Marty; actor Eric Stoltz was cast first. But this recasting made movie history. While on a panel at the New York Comic Con (NYCC) in October 2022, Lloyd said they had "immediate chemistry," via <a href=#>The A.V. Club</a>. With Lloyd turning 84 and Fox now in his 60s, they're still close over 30 years later. The <a href=#>New York Post</a> reported that during 2022's NYCC, Fox told the audience that "the best part of the movie was working with Chris."</p><p>Decades later, in 2021, Lloyd told <a href=#>Looper</a> that every time he sees Fox is a gift. "It's a thrill whenever we get together. He has just such a loving, wonderful sense of himself in his situation in time," Lloyd said. "Really, he just has a perspective, and a sense of humor about it, and a kind of joy. He loves being who is and being able to [show] it. For me, to be involved in this made all of us feel good about what we were doing, and why we were doing it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhobYBygo6wn5qsXZi1s7XSraapoJWneq24zrKbZpmemXqutcKhmJ6kXZ96p7vXrGSrnZyWwaq7zayfoqhdnsBuuMiknGasn5muuns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
