After all these years, details still remain unknown about the case or investigation.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Today retired Las Vegas police officer&nbsp;Chris Carroll decided to speak up about that night, and what he remembers being the first officer to respond on the scene. Carroll was patrolling the grounds on his bike when he received the call of gunfire near the intersection of Flamingo and Koval around 11:15 p.m. According to Carroll, when he initially attempted to get Tupac to reveal the identity of his shooter, ‘Pac was too busy “trying to yell at Suge”.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"So I’m looking at Tupac, and he’s trying to yell back at Suge, and I’m asking him, ‘Who shot you? What happened? Who did it?’ And he was just kind of ignoring me. He was making eye contact with me here and there, but he’s trying to yell at Suge. And I kept asking over and over, ‘Who did this? Who shot you?’ And he basically kept ignoring me. And then I saw in his face, in his movements, all of a sudden in the snap of a finger, he changed. And he went from struggling to speak, being noncooperative, to an ‘I’m at peace’ type of thing. Just like that."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Carroll then details the last words Tupac uttered before he started gurgling and slipping out of consciousness:</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"He looked at me and he took a breath to get the words out, and he opened his mouth, and I thought I was actually going to get some cooperation. And then the words came out: ‘Fuck you'."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Read Chris Carroll's entire take on Tupac's last living moments <a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"><strong>right here</strong></a>.</p><p><br><h2>tupac</h2></p><p>Cop Says Tupac's Last Words Were "F*ck You"</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Kevin Goddard is an editor for HNHH.
