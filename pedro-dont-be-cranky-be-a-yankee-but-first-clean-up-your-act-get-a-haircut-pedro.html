BUT FIRST CLEAN UP YOUR ACT; GET A HAIRCUT, PEDRO!</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>IF Red Sox star Pedro Martinez joins the Yankees next season, the pitching ace is going to need a new image – fast.</p><p>George Steinbrenner is said to be salivating over the quirky, hottempered Bostonian – but he must also be gagging over his Jheri-curled mop, fuzzy goatee and baggy uniform.</p><p>Could a slob like Pedro possibly fit into the best-looking team in baseball – one that Steinbrenner insists be clean-cut and well-dressed at all times?</p><p>“Pedro is one ugly S.O.B.,,” concedes local Sox fan Zachary Thacher. “He has long, nasty hair and a goatee. All of that will have to go if he’s a Yankee.”</p><p>Martinez, 33, needs nothing short of a total makeover, says our panel of experts.</p><p>For starters, there are Steinbrenner’s hairstyle rules: hair short, face clean.</p><p>“I like men that look like men,” says Kyle White, a hairstylist and colorist at Oscar Blandi. “I would give him a short, masculine haircut – or even shave it.”</p><p>His oil supply will also be cut off. “Greasy hair is never good,” White says. “You don’t want to run your fingers through that.”</p><p>The hairstylist – who says he doesn’t have a problem with Martinez’s facial hair – would pare down the styling products to just one, or maybe none.</p><p>“I don’t think he would need much of anything,” he says. “Just maybe a little pomade.”</p><p>On the field, Martinez will have to ditch the pooka beads and two-sizes-too-big uniform.</p><p>Off-duty, he’ll have to compete with impeccably dressed teammates like Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez, the latter of whom made last year’s Best Dressed list in Esquire.</p><p>“You can be a slob in Boston, but not in New York,” says stylist Wayne Scot Lukas, who advocates a total metrosexual overhaul.</p><p>“First, I’d send him to Eighth Avenue, to hit all the gay stores,” says Lukas. “The salespeople will worship him!”</p><p>If Martinez really wants to score a hit, adds Lukas, he should try to get a cocktail named after himself as soon as possible.</p><p>Stacy Vale, director of personal shopping for Scoop boutiques, says the pitcher should stick to dark colors like black, navy and gray.</p><p>“Get great shoes, a great suit. Some Michael Kors trousers. In New York, even when we go casual, we look great.”</p><p>Plastic surgeons have their own ideas on how to streamline Pedro’s image.</p><p>“He would benefit from liposuction under the jawline,” says Manhattan plastic surgeon Alan Matarasso, who notes that Martinez has a habit of ducking behind his glove when he’s conferencing on the field.</p><p>“You can remove the fat from inside the cheeks – it’s called a buccal fat pad. Removing it gives a more angular appearance to the face. Then he wouldn’t have to hide his face with his glove,” says Matarasso.</p><p>Details are essential for completing any look – but we’re not sure about Martinez’s favorite accessory: a midget.</p><p>Martinez’s diminutive pal Nelson De La Rosa – the third smallest man in the world – is supposedly a good luck charm for the pitcher.</p><p>Somehow, that doesn’t seem likely to go with the dapper Yankee image.</p><p>“Midgets went out with Kid Rock,” says Lukas. “It’s tired. If you’re gonna have a sidekick, get a dog.”</p><p>—–</p><p>Here comes the pitch</p><p>Pedro, get in the game! Here’s how he can trade that Beantown blah-blah-blah for The City That Never Sweeps, um, Sleeps.</p><p>1) Put a Zimmer-style smackdown on Red Sox manager Terry Francona.</p><p>2) Get 55,000 Yankee fans to switch the chant from “Who’s Your Daddy?” to “No hard fee-lings!”</p><p>3) Trade in little pal Nelson de la Rosa for big-city babe magnet Verne (“Mini-Me”) Troyer.</p><p>4) Choose his own Yankee Stadium theme song – maybe Joni Mitchell’s “Both Sides Now.”</p><p>5) Become Derek Jeter’s new wingman and charm supermodels over chicken parmigiana at Elio’s.</p><p>– Michael Kane</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2JlfXV7kGlma3BfpbKlvs5mm6impGKvpnnCq5ino6lir6Z5wGawmqabmrJurtStZJ%2BhoqjBbq%2FLnpinZaWlerq71KtkmpukYrSmwIyaZKGZmaewtsCMqZydqp9k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
