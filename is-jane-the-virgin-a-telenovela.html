Is it considered a telenovela?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: youtube / jane the virgin</a></figure><p>The CW's romantic dramedy <a href=#>Jane the Virgin</a> made a star of <a href=#>Gina Rodriguez</a>.</p><p>The five-season series follows Gina as leading lady Jane Villanueva, a young, religious Latina who is a virgin. But shortly after we meet Jane, she finds out she's pregnant after a mixup at her gynecologist's office that led her to be artificially inseminated by mistake (!!!).</p><p>Things intensify even more when Jane learns that the father of her future child is actually her boss Rafael Solano (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Baldoni</a>). Oh, and did we mention that she's engaged to someone else at the time?</p><p>The series, which is available to watch on <a href=#>Netflix</a>, follows Jane as she navigates motherhood with her accidental baby daddy while trying to maintain her own love life.</p><p>Given how theatrical the series is and Jane's Latin heritage, many folks can't help but wonder: Is Jane the Virgin considered a telenovela?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>'Jane the Virgin' producer Jennie Snyder Urman and Gina Rodriguez</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is 'Jane the Virgin' a telenovela?</h2><p>Before we reveal the answer, let's define what a telenovela is to start. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Merriam Webster</a>, the meaning of telenovela is "a soap opera produced in and televised in or from many Latin American countries."</p><p>Some popular titles include <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Queen of Flow</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">All for Love</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">La Reina del Sur</a>, which were all produced in either Central or South America and exclusively star Spanish-speaking actors.</p><p>Jane the Virgin doesn't exactly fit that criterion. You see the series is set in Miami, Fla. but according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seeing Stars</a>, most of its filming took place in various locations in and around Los Angeles, Cali.</p><p>Another thing to note is that the series is mostly in English. While Jane's heritage is nodded to at times, she has become very well-acquainted with American culture.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>So, Jane the Virgin is basically an Americanized telenovela for white people?</p>‚Äî first of all, bitch, ... (@thejournalista) <a href=#>July 28, 2021</a></figure><p>However, ironically enough, Jane the Virgin is based on the 2002 telenovela by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Juana la Virgen</a> by Perla Far√≠as which originally aired on the now-shuttered Venezuelan television network Radio Caracas Televisi√≥n (RCTV).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hating on the fake death plot line in Jane the Virgin is crazy considering it‚Äôs literally a nod to telenovelas considering Jane the Virgin was a, walk with me, telenovela</p>‚Äî kaeüê© (@kaelinbby) <a href=#>April 11, 2023</a></figure><p>In Juana la Virgen, actress Daniela Alvarado played Juana P√©rez, a 16-year-old student who accidentally became pregnant by artificial insemination due to a hospital error. Juana la Virgen and Jane the Virgin are very similar in plot but what makes the former a telenovela is its Latin American foundation and style.</p><p>So no, Jane the Virgin is not a real telenovela, but it is an Emmy-nominated American television series that will never be forgotten.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsButsCnnGasmJp6t7XRoKCnZZFiwaa4xKemr52clg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
