They’re feeling uncomfortable right along with Witherspoon, in retrospect, as they digest just how young the actress was during filming.</p><h2 id=h-reese-witherspoon-s-age-in-fear-explained data-injectable=false>Reese Witherspoon’s age in Fear, explained</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=598 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>When filming for Fear was taking place, Witherspoon was technically still in her teenage years. She was only 19 when the now-infamous sex scene was filmed — alongside Wahlberg, then 25 — but that didn’t stop Foley from stomping all over her comfort levels. He insisted that she participate in the scene herself, and it helped shape Witherspoon into the woman she is today.</p><p data-characters=709 data-current-count=1091 data-injectable=true>That scene, and the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">lack of control</a> Witherspoon felt, prompted the actress to create her production company, Hello Sunshine. The company aims to “tell stories from a female perspective instead of from the male gaze,” and provide a more welcoming space for incoming stars — in particular, women. It also aims to tell a different sort of story, and from different perspectives than the bulk of Hollywood offerings. As noted by Witherspoon, “It’s not just the art that’s being made, it’s how it’s being made. A man telling a story about the suffragette movement is a different thing than a woman telling it whose grandmother told her the story while she was sitting on her lap.”</p><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=247 data-injectable=false>So, as it turns out, that loss of control with Fear made something good after all. Without that long-ago scene, and Foley’s refusal to shift his vision to accommodate Witherspoon’s boundaries, Hello Sunshine may never have come to be.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMqKOdZaeWwG6%2BxJ6qnmWnnsGpsdGsp6innmK2r3nFnpirZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
