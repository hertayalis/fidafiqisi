He is known for his entertaining lip-syncs, pranks, challenge videos, and sketch-comedy clips on the platform. Most of his videos have texts in them. His account on the platform has already gained more than 665 million likes and over 25.3 million fans.</span></p><p><span>In June 2020, he featured Australian reality TV star and social-media sensation, Harry Jowsey, of Too Hot to Handle and Heartbreak Island fame in one of his TikTok videos. One of his pranks involved masquerading as a bush on a sidewalk and surprising passers-by while recording their reactions.</span></p><p><span>He has his own channel on YouTube, titled SwagBoyQ. Launched on May 3, 2012, the channel has gained over 1.65 million subscribers and more than 883 million views. It hosts pranks, vlogs, and challenge videos in a longer format.</span></p><p><span>SwagBoyQ’s Instagram account, “swagboyq”, has 1.3 million followers. Though he promotes his merchandise through the account, it is, surprisingly, a private account, unlike the accounts of other social-media stars of his age. This means that only people whose requests he accepts on Instagram will be able to view his content on the platform.</span></p><p><span>He is also available on Snapchat as TheSwagBoyQ. His brand of merchandise is available on the website swagboyq.com. It sells apparel and accessories geared toward the youth. SwagBoyQ launched his official Twitter account, Theswagboyq, in April 2012. The profile has gained more than 29k followers to date. His fans are called the “ShwaggyGang.” He believes that this gang is more like a family. He once said in an interview that his sole purpose in life is to put a smile on the faces of people who follow him, and he chooses entertainment to make the world a better place.</span></p><p><span>In a January 2020 live session with The Hype Magazine, SwagBoyQ mentioned a lot of things about himself. He said he grew up watching comedians and actors such as Kevin Hart and aspired to be like them. However, he knew that he would have to work hard to get where these established actors were, in terms of fame. He then decided to do something worthwhile to reach his goal.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p class=ql-align-center>Source - Instagram</p><p><span>He also joked about how he was “kicked out” of places such as Walmart, Target, and Foot Locker, as those were the venues he often chose for his pranks. He even described how Walmart now keeps an eye on him whenever he visits any store in the country. However, he also mentioned how he feels lucky to be recognized by random people on the streets, in malls, and elsewhere, who come up to him for autographs and selfies. He thus believes that social media fame has both positives and negatives.</span></p><p><span>He also mentioned how he stops his pranks if they get too serious, to avoid getting into legal hassles. However, he believes his pranks help him interact with different types of people, and that allows him to observe people’s personalities and helps him grow. He believes some people from his hometown hate him for having achieved so much fame by just being himself, but he was fine with it. SwagBoyQ also believes making money is good but one should also spend time doing something one loves, in order to enjoy life. He encourages people not to make their lives miserable by just working for money but to also pursue some hobby to make life worthwhile.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2b7%2FPqKmtq5uasqWtjZympmeknri1u8porqGnXZ7Abr%2FWmp6bp6mm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
