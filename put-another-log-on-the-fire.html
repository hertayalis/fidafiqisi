The song's narrator, who is male, demands that his partner fawn over him and cater to his every whim, from cooking him bacon and beans to fetching his slippers and boiling him tea. Meanwhile, the primary focus of the song is the singer's confusion as to why his partner is leaving him.</p><br><p>While the misogyny of the lyrics is undeniable, there is a hint of irony in the song as well. The singer's insistence that he is doing everything right, from warning his partner when she is "getting fat" to taking her sister driving every night, is undercut by the fact that his partner is leaving him. This suggests that, despite his efforts to control and manipulate his partner, he still cannot understand why she would want to leave him.</p><br><p>Ultimately, "Put Another Log On The Fire" is a powerful statement on the gender dynamics that were prevalent in the 1970s. The song's portrayal of a man who expects his partner to serve him and fulfill his every desire is a damning critique of the cultural norms that were in place at the time.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Put another log on the fire</u><br>I need you to keep the fire burning because it's cold in here</p><br><p><u>Cook me up some bacon and some beans</u><br>I'm hungry and want you to cook me something</p><br><p><u>And go out to the car and change the tire</u><br>My tire needs changing and I want you to do it</p><br><p><u>Wash my socks and sew my old blue jeans</u><br>I need clean socks and my jeans fixed</p><br><p><u>Come on, baby, you can fill my pipe</u><br>I want you to fill my pipe with tobacco</p><br><p><u>And then go fetch my slippers</u><br>I want my slippers brought to me</p><br><p><u>And boil me up another pot of tea</u><br>I want more tea to drink</p><br><p><u>Then put another log on the fire, babe</u><br>I need the fire to keep burning</p><br><p><u>And come and tell me why you're leaving me</u><br>I suspect you're leaving me, so please tell me why</p><br><p><u>Now don't I let you wash the car on Sunday?</u><br>I do nice things for you, like let you wash the car on Sundays</p><br><p><u>Don't I warn you when you're gettin fat?</u><br>I give you constructive criticism so that you don't get overweight</p><br><p><u>Ain't I gonna take you fishin' with me someday?</u><br>I have plans to take you fishing with me in the future</p><br><p><u>Well, a man can't love a woman more than that</u><br>I believe I have shown you that I love you</p><br><p><u>Ain't I always nice to your kid sister?</u><br>I treat your sister with kindness</p><br><p><u>Don't I take her driving every night?</u><br>I chauffeur your sister every night</p><br><p><u>So, sit here at my feet 'cause I like you when you're sweet</u><br>I want you to sit here next to me and be sweet to me</p><br><p><u>And you know it ain't feminine to fight</u><br>Fighting is not a feminine quality, so please don't do it</p><br><p><u>Go out to the car and lift it up and change the tire</u><br>I need you to change my tire by lifting up the car</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © O/B/O APRA AMCOS<br>Written by: Shel Silverstein</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maI%2BRrrmwur6DnKemmaO0tHuvrquYeZ6kwamx0ZiDqJ%2BPhLugoMeeln%2Bhopo%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
