Newspaper clippings, magazine clippings, stories, recipes – sometimes they come in the mail, sometimes she saves them up for a&nbsp;visit. A couple of years ago she brought me&nbsp;a recipe for a couscous salad&nbsp;clipped from&nbsp;Edible Michiana that was similar to this one. We made it, loved it… then later I lost it. But I could never get this sweet & savory flavor combo out of my mind so I’ve been making versions of it ever since. The original recipe used couscous but I used quinoa here because it’s the grain I usually have on&nbsp;hand. I…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Fall happened for me last night. I stepped off the plane at Midway Airport (in shorts) and immediately thought “they really have the AC blasting here.” Until I realized, oh wait, that’s&nbsp;just&nbsp;Chicago. As I write this, I’m sitting in the kitchen I grew up in (with a few sweaters on), thinking&nbsp;about some of my warmest fall memories… Saturday mornings with pancakes and waffles are definitely at the top the list. Crisp, cool air, hot waffles… and&nbsp;most likely the&nbsp;Muppet Babies on TV in the background. Make-Ahead Vegan Waffles These vegan waffles are great right off the waffle iron, but lately (especially…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>You probably don’t need a recipe to make a sandwich but I couldn’t help but share this big juicy stack of late-summer grilled veggies. I rarely make sandwiches these days, (mostly because I live in the town of tacos)…&nbsp;but these simply grilled eggplant slices were just begging to be put between bread and slathered with arugula-walnut pesto. I piled on some roasted peppers and fresh mozzarella.&nbsp;Sub avocado for the cheese if you’re vegan. Then get out the napkins because things are gonna get messy! You can assemble your sandwich like I did, or put the&nbsp;ingredients on a platter so everyone…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This is my go-to healthy granola recipe. Packed with oats and nuts and naturally sweetened with maple syrup, it’s a great way to get fiber and healthy fats into your first meal of the day. Even better, it clumps well! I add a tablespoon of almond butter to bind the components together, so you get plenty of delicious nutty clusters. I like to make it on Sunday and have it on hand for yogurt parfaits throughout the week! While we don’t have kids that are&nbsp;going back to school this week,&nbsp;I’m starting to think more and more about healthy make-ahead breakfast…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>We have a new superfood obsession – we’re head over heels in love with&nbsp;tart cherries. It started with this froyo recipe,&nbsp;but since then I’ve been tossing frozen tart cherries into our morning smoothies and mixing tart cherry juice into cocktails, (among other simple uses)… It’s an understatement to say that Jack and I both drink a lot of iced tea. While I usually prefer unsweetened tea – I’ve found that adding just a splash of tart cherry juice to plain black tea (or green tea) is so deliciously tangy and refreshing… and just slightly sweet, which is the way I…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>People like to ask me “what’s your favorite recipe?”&nbsp;and I never have an answer. My “favorite” is often what’s most recent and/or what’s coming up next… But this one combines two definite favorites – blistered shishito peppers (which I usually make as an appetizer), and one of my go-to simple soba noodle recipes.&nbsp;Because&nbsp;my “favorites” are almost always&nbsp;the simple things. I brought home a bunch of shishito peppers from the farmers market, but the base of this recipe is so versatile – feel free to sub in a star vegetable of your choice. The noodles get tossed in a light sesame-soy…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>We’re all familiar with the ubiquitous portobello burger, so I’ll be honest: I originally planned to serve these mushrooms in hot dog buns for the novelty of it. For my money, though, portobellos really work better in dog form than in burger-form. They get more fully covered in the tangy, savory marinade, and (because they’re thinner strips) they cook a lot more quickly and more evenly. Portobello Veggie Dog Recipe Ingredients Growing up around Chicago, hot dogs were never taken lightly. A good Chicago dog has a myriad of components, including mustard, onions, a whole pickle, peppers, and more.

In fact, you should try this recipe even if you don’t have any summer squash on hand. The crispy, nutty Parmesan and panko topping contrasts perfectly with the saucy zucchini, pesto, and marinara underneath. It’s super simple to put together, and it can pass as a side dish or a meal on its own. Make this zucchini casserole recipe once, and you’ll have it on repeat all summer long.

This recipe was created from as many things from my Farmhouse Delivery&nbsp;(a local CSA-like farm share) box that I could fit into one meal. I received a sweet potato the size of my small dog Annie, and a bunch of tiny&nbsp;grape tomatoes&nbsp;– so I thought hearty tostadas with fresh, spicy salsa would be fitting&nbsp;for an in-between seasonal dinner. The okra here isn’t totally necessary but I had tons to use up&nbsp;so in it went.

(And I totally feel for you).&nbsp;Hopefully, you are not also&nbsp;allergic to seeds because my current obsession is this spread made from sunflower seeds. Sunflower seeds blend up to become a similar texture to ricotta, although the flavor of this spread is a bit more&nbsp;rich & tangy. I’ve posted similar recipes in the past&nbsp;–&nbsp;this time I’ve altered it to use easier-to-find ingredients.…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>A few weeks ago, I had dinner with my friend Grace, and she brought me the most delicious homemade blackberry jam. Since making jam isn’t really my jam, I asked her if she would come over and share a recipe for the blog. I love peaches, and they were in peak season, so we decided on spicy peach jam. And last weekend, we jammed. Well, technically, she jammed. I watched. Jack took pictures. How to Make Peach Jam Canning aside, I was surprised how easy this peach jam recipe was.
