Little did they know that not only would he one day don the utility belt and sit in the Batmobile but that he would bring forth the worst iteration of Batman ever, and that's saying a lot. If you haven't recently seen the Val Kilmer and George Clooney versions, they were pretty bad, but they look like Citizen Kane after seeing Zak Snyder's vision of the Caped Crusader.</p><p>But could it be some evil movie exec saw this clue in 2008 and started getting ideas?
