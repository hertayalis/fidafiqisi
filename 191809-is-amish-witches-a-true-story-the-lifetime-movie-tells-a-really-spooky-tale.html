Well, does Lifetime have the movie for you! The network will be premiering the film <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Amish Witches: The True Story of Holmes County</i></a> on Saturday, Oct. 29 at 8 p.m. ET. But <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>is <i>Amish Witches</i> a true story</a>, as its title suggests?</p><p>That's actually kind of a tricky question to answer. Yes, the words "true story" are in the title of the movie and a preview clip says it's "based on real events," but there doesn't seem to be any evidence that anything similar to what will happen in the film actually occurred in real life. Here's the synopsis of the movie via Lifetime's website:</p>When a reality TV crew comes to Holmes County, Ohio to document the lives of an isolated sect of Amish, production is halted by the death of a Brauchau [an Amish witch]. Following her unconsecrated funeral, a small group of young Amish women solicit the TV crew's help in attempting to document the inexplicable events plaguing them. But as everyone soon discovers, the powerful malevolent force haunting them has deadly intentions.<p>So this description of the movie then made me think, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>as one blogger on Amish365.com has also pointed out</a>, that <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Amish Witches: The True Story of Holmes County</i></a> is actually the title of the fake reality TV show featured in the film, so what happens in the show is the "true story," not what the movie is based upon. It kind of seems like this film could be in the tradition of found footage horror movies, such as <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>The Blair Witch Project</i> </a>or <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Paranormal Activity</i> </a>, where it's made to look like a documentary but is really just pure fiction.</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Click Here To Watch</b></a></p><p>Reading the synopsis of <i>Amish Witches</i>, of course, made me immediately think of all of those reality shows featuring the Amish that have come out in the past few years, particularly <i>Breaking Amish</i> since it not only documented young men and women in the Amish community but also featured witchcraft as a major topic of conversation among the cast members. In Season 1 in New York, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Kate was accused of being a witch</a>, and in Season 2 in Los Angeles, Betsy openly practiced witchcraft and even claimed she put a hex on her castmates.</p><p></p><p>While all of this was going down during their respective seasons, most of the <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Breaking Amish</i></a> cast members stated that witchcraft is not generally accepted by the Amish people, who practice a very strict form of Christianity. However, witchcraft has still been linked to the Amish in a sense in <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>brauche</i> or powwowing, a spiritual healing practice,</a> according to anthropologist David W. Kriebel. It has been practiced by the Amish ever since the first German-speaking Protestant settlers arrived in Pennsylvania in the 18th century.</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Click Here To Watch</b></a></p><p></p><p>There has been one popular legend of an Amish witch known as the Chesterville Witch. As the story goes, there's a grave in Chesterville, Illinois said to belong to a young woman who was thought to be <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>a witch and was banished by her Amish community</a>, according to the book <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Weird Illinois</i> </a>. She disappeared, and her body was later found in a farmer's field. She was buried in Chesterville Cemetery, and a tree was planted on her gravesite in an effort to trap her spirit. Some people believe that if the tree ever dies or is removed, the witch's spirit will escape and wreak havoc on the town. There have also been reported sightings of the Chesterville Witch at the gravesite. It's unclear if there's any truth to this tale, but this story certainly does give you the chills.</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Click Here To Buy</b></a></p><p>So clearly, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Amish Witches</i></a> is rooted in a lot of history and folklore. But even if you didn't know about all of that, you would still probably have a scary good time watching this film.</p><p><i>Image: Lifetime</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyhZBxZ3Jlmah6ornIrJ9mr5mpsKmx0maYZqyiqrJuv9OoqbJlpJ2ybrjIn5ytoZ2aeq671aKcZqyVobm0ecBmqZ6ZnKHGbr%2FPqKaksV2prq2x</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
