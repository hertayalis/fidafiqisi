She made her first AEW appearance in September 2021. At the time, it was unclear how many matches PVZ would have in AEW. She was placed in Dan Lambert’s American Top Team stable, but she mostly just stood in the background and made non-verbal gestures.</p><p>Paige VanZant last appeared for AEW in May 2022. It’s been almost a year since she was seen on Tony Khan’s television show. This leads a lot of people to wonder what happened to her, and the answer isn’t quite clear.</p><p><a href=#>Ringside News</a> reached out to ask around what happened with Paige VanZant in AEW. Not one source within AEW has any idea why PVZ isn’t around anymore.</p><p>As we previously reported, <a href=#>Paige VanZant ghosted her pro wrestling</a> training with Gangrel. She just stopped putting in the work, and now that <a href=#>Dan Lambert is no longer appearing on AEW television</a>, it’s likely she’s done with the company.</p><p>Paige VanZant is dealing with <a href=#>a broken foot injury right now</a>. That’s why she is rocking boot in<a href=#> her recent bikini photos.</a> If she is going to make a return to AEW, then it’s not going to happen until that foot is healed.</p><p>We’ll have to see what’s next for Paige VanZant. Right now, she is making <a href=#>an absolute killing baring all on OnlyFans, </a>so she really doesn’t need to take bumps in the ring.</p><p>What’s your take on this situation with AEW and Paige VanZant?
