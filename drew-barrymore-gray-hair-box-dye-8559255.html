The talk show host and actress opened up to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>People</a>&nbsp;about her hair color, saying that she's not quite ready to go gray just yet. While she has no problem with other people that do, she's happy to have box dye available to cover up her grays. The beloved host recently&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow>partnered with Nutrisse</a>&nbsp;for her own hair color, Dark Natural Blonde.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I do love that it's trending and looks so beautiful and is like a fashion statement," she told&nbsp;People. "But I just don't feel ready to go down that road."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added that she's not "completely gray," but that she has enough where she needs dye to cover them up. Of course, in her signature comic style, she noted that when she's older, she could very well look a certain way. For now, though, she's dying her hair with abandon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm only 48, so it's not completely gray, but I definitely have lot of gray hairs," she explained. "But I can also keep dyeing it. I don't really care if I look like a Just For Men ad when I'm older."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Michael Loccisano/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's almost a bronze," she said of her signature color. She even appears on the product's packaging â€”&nbsp;a first for her. "It's not too light. Light is something I can't do anymore because of the maintenance. I can't deal with roots, roots, roots."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another aspect of aging that Barrymore addressed was plastic surgery. She said that she hasn't gone under the knife just yet, but is also open to the idea if it presents itself, whether that's a minor procedure like injectibles or something bigger. Again, she dropped a Just For Men joke to remind everyone tht she doesn't take herelf too seriously.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Never say never, but I haven't resorted to it yet," she said of injectibles and fillers. "I'm going to maintain that for as long as possible. Because I'm not only interested in seeing myself as a Just For Men ad, but also as an old leather bag."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Barrymore added that she has an addictive personality, so if she were to start, she fears that she'd get more and more done.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I fear I would continue to chase that, and be like, now this, and that," she said before giving a shoutout to one of her beauty icons. "I saw something from Cindy Crawford on her social saying that she embraced aging. That's such positive, healthy messaging. She was like, it means you're here, that you're alive, that you're living."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57w6ucsGWSlr%2BzxcyoqZ5ll6euunnHmqCrZZKkxW6w2J5kcW1lbn92gQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
