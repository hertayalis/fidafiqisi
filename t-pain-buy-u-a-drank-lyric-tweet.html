"And 'an then' not 'ooh wee' but really it's whatever you want it to be just enjoy the song however you hear it. I just appreciate you listening," he tweeted. Ugh, seriously, what did we do to deserve T-Pain?! He later clarified another one of his iconic lyrics, and casually shattered everything we thought we knew about life. NBD. He wrote, "I don't wanna throw another wrench in your childhood but also it's 'Everybody's hands go UP... and they stay there... AND THEY SAY YEAH.' Sorry. &nbsp;#AllIDoIsWin. I'm from [Tallahassee] bro. That's just how some of us talk."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>It‚Äôs ‚Äúand then‚Äù not ‚Äúooh wee‚Äù but really it‚Äôs whatever you want it to be just enjoy the song however you hear it.
