Boys – each of you have a big decision to make. So I’m gonna ask you one by one if you want to stick with your partner who has been away in Casa Amor for the past few days, or whether you want to recouple with one of these gorgeous girls standing in front of you.

He ultimately whittled it down to Cheyanne because he wanted someone more reserved and was only getting “friend vibes” from the former. Thankfully, there were no hard feelings, possibly because she sneaked a kiss with Davide.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2022/07/love_island_sr8_ep32_03-1024x576.jpg><p>Tasha and Andrew’s romance gets tested after both parties are seen locking lips with the newbies.
