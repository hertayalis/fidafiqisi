Although the entire franchise consists of eight Japanese films, those various remakes, spin-offs, and sequels are hard to find outside of Japan, so the United States is more familiar with its 2002 remake and subsequent sequels.</p>Recommended Videos<h2 id=h-what-is-the-ring-franchise data-injectable=false>What is The Ring franchise?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-29-edited.png><p data-characters=529 data-current-count=829 data-injectable=true>Suzuki’s novel debuted in 1991 and spawned five more installments in Spiral (1995), Loop (1998), Birthday (1999), S (2012), and Tide (2013). Further print publications include seven comic books that were released alongside the novels. Along with the Japanese film collection and printed works, Suzuki’s supernatural horror franchise comprises two television series, three English-language film&nbsp;remakes, a Korean film remake, and two video games:&nbsp;The Ring: Terror’s Realm,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ring: Infinity.</p><h3 id=h-japanese-films data-injectable=false>Japanese Films:</h3><ul data-current-count=207 data-injectable=false><li>Ring (1998)</li><li>Ring 2 (1999)</li><li>Ring 0: Birthday (2000)</li><li>Sadako 3D (2012)</li><li>Sadako 3D 2 (2013)</li><li>Sadako vs. Kayoko (2016)</li><li>Sadoka KOL (2019)</li><li>Sadoko DX (2022)</li></ul><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=606 data-injectable=true>However, many American viewers might be more familiar with the equally terrifying remake. Directed by Gore Verbinski, the US version of The Ring follows journalist&nbsp;Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), who investigates a videotape that had allegedly killed four teenagers (including her niece). There is an urban legend surrounding the tape that prophesies the viewer will die seven days after watching it.</p><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=256 data-injectable=false>Unbeknownst to Rachel until later on in the film, the curse originates from Sadako Yamamura (renamed Samara Morgan in the American remakes), a vengeful ghost capable of nensha (thoughtography), which she uses as a means to kill whoever views the videotape.</p><p data-characters=112 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>For convenience to binge-watchers and horror junkies everywhere, here are all the American Ring movies in order.</p><h2 id=h-the-ring-2002 data-injectable=false>The Ring&nbsp;(2002)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/The-Ring-2002-Samara-Morgan.jpg><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=273 data-injectable=false>The Ring (2002) kick-started the American film franchise with Naomi Watt’s Rachel, a Seattle investigative journalist who experiences the effects of the cursed videotape first-hand when her niece, Katie (Amber Tamblyn), dies a week after watching it with her friends.</p><p data-characters=450 data-current-count=723 data-injectable=true>When asked to uncover the exact cause of Katie’s death, Rachel visits the Shelter Mountain Inn, the location in which Katie and her friends viewed the tape. After watching it, Rachel faces impending death and begins to see images from the tape superimposed in her environment. She learns about Samara Morgan, the adopted daughter of Anna Morgan, a horse breeder, who can psychically etch images&nbsp;onto objects and into people’s minds.</p><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=true>Theatrically released on October 18, 2002, The Ring received positive reviews with particular praise for its atmosphere and visuals as well as Watt’s performance. It went on to become one of the highest-grossing horror remakes ever made. The Ring turned out to be so influential that it inspired American remakes of other Asian horror films, such as&nbsp;The Grudge,&nbsp;Dark Water,&nbsp;Shutter, and&nbsp;The Eye.</p><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=193 data-injectable=false>This inaugural film can be streamed on Fubo, MGM+, Paramount+, and Roku.

Interestingly, Rings is included as a bonus feature on The Ring Two‘s DVD, so it’s safe to assume that the short film correlates with canon and continuity.</p><p data-characters=561 data-current-count=561 data-injectable=true>Sometime after The Ring, Samara Morgan’s cursed videotape has gone viral; each time someone watches it, they make a copy and share it around, and then the cycle continues. From the soaring popularity of the videotape, a subculture has formed wherein people test the seven-day deadline and see how close they can get before chickening out and passing the tape along. Online groups dedicated to the phenomenon are called “rings,” one of which recruits Jake Pierce (Ryan Merriman) to document his experiences after agreeing to take the challenge.</p><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=196 data-injectable=false>Rings is available to stream on Fubo, Paramount+, Showtime, and DirectTV.

Hideo Nakata, the director of the original Japanese Ring (1988), helmed the project in place of Gore Verbinski. Set six months after the events of The Ring and immediately after Rings, the cursed videotape has circulated as far as Astoria, Oregon. Jake Pierce (Ryan Merriman) is on his seventh day, so he asks his friend, Emily (Emily VanCamp) to watch the tape. Shortly thereafter, Rachel (Watts) obtains the tape and destroys it, but Samara Morgan – the ghost who cursed the footage — pursues Rachel and her son, Aidan, whom she tries to possess.</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>Unlike its predecessor, The Ring Two was received negatively by critics despite grossing US$35 million during its opening weekend, which more than doubles the opening weekend of&nbsp;The Ring. Although its domestic gross total was significantly less than the original, it earned a total gross of $163 million internationally.</p><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true>The Ring Two can be streamed on Fubo, Paramount+, Showtime, and DirectTV.

Javier Gutiérrez serving as director. It was based on the Spiral novel by&nbsp;Kōji Suzuki. Originally, Paramount Pictures&nbsp;had planned a third film to be titled&nbsp;The Ring 3D in early 2014,&nbsp;but once Gutiérrez came on board, plans changed.</p><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=226 data-injectable=false>Written by&nbsp;David Loucka,&nbsp;Jacob Aaron Estes,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Akiva Goldsman, Rings stars Matilda Lutz,&nbsp;Alex Roe,&nbsp;Johnny Galecki,&nbsp;Aimee Teegarden,&nbsp;Bonnie Morgan,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Vincent D’Onofrio.</p><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=663 data-injectable=true>Lutz portrays Julia, a young woman who becomes worried about her boyfriend Holt (Roe) when he explores the “rings” subculture that challenges members to watch Samara Morgan’s cursed videotape. Julia sacrifices herself to save Holt, but in doing so, she makes a horrifying discovery. Released in February 2017, Rings opened at #2 at the box office and grossed $83&nbsp;million worldwide, despite being critically panned.</p><p data-characters=184 data-current-count=184 data-injectable=false>This film is currently not available to stream but can be bought or rented on a number of platforms. These include Amazon, Google Play, YouTube, Apple TV, Vudu, Redbox, and Microsoft.</p><h2 id=h-could-there-be-more-ring-films-in-the-future data-injectable=false>Could there be more Ring films in the future?</h2><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=true>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloody Disgusting</a>, The Grudge&nbsp;director&nbsp;Nicolas Pesce&nbsp;expressed interest in a&nbsp;crossover film&nbsp;between&nbsp;The Grudge&nbsp;and the English-language&nbsp;The Ring&nbsp;film series in September 2019. This would be similar to the 2016 Japanese film Sadako vs. Kayako, which pitted the icons of the original Japanese franchises together.</p><p data-characters=154 data-current-count=154 data-injectable=false>Although three years have passed since then, the window of opportunity remains open for a crossover between two very similar yet distinctive horror icons.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXam8bsPArZqhZZGhuW7Ax55kq6GenHquu9WinKxlmaN6sL7Dnqlo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
