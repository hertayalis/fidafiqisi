While last week had us guessing at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Theon Greyjoy’s intentions</a> (RIP), this week our sights are set on Tyrion Lannister. Sansa and Tyrion shared a rather emotional moment down in the crypts — could it be that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Sansa is having second thoughts</a> about her (favorite) ex-husband?</p><p><a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/jonas-turner-1-1.jpg alt='TORONTO, ONTARIO - SEPTEMBER 12: (L-R) Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner attend the "Devotion" Premiere at Cinesphere on September 12, 2022 in Toronto, Ontario.' height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="c-span u-letter-spacing-015 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase a-font-secondary-bold-s lrv-u-font-size-14 lrv-u-margin-t-050 lrv-u-margin-t-1@desktop lrv-u-margin-b-025 u-margin-tb-00@tablet lrv-u-display-block">Related story</span> <span class="c-title a-font-secondary-medium-s@mobile-max a-font-primary-xs@tablet lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-margin-b-1 u-margin-t-050@tablet lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-color-brand-primary:hover">Joe Jonas Shared a Very Cryptic Message Amid His Contentious Split From Sophie Turner</span></a></p><p>Sansa and Tyrion have both changed dramatically since they were last in close quarters with one another. Forced to marry, the young Sansa was disgusted by Tyrion, while Tyrion resented the marriage due to his ongoing relationship with Shae. In the years after, Sansa was tortured by Ramsay Bolton and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">emerged as a hardened Lady of Winterfell</a>. Tyrion lost the love of his life, pledged allegiance to Daenerys Targaryen and has been accused of losing his edge in recent years — most recently by Sansa herself.</p><p><a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/jonas-turner-1-1.jpg alt='TORONTO, ONTARIO - SEPTEMBER 12: (L-R) Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner attend the "Devotion" Premiere at Cinesphere on September 12, 2022 in Toronto, Ontario.' height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="c-span u-letter-spacing-015 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase a-font-secondary-bold-s lrv-u-font-size-14 lrv-u-margin-t-050 lrv-u-margin-t-1@desktop lrv-u-margin-b-025 u-margin-tb-00@tablet lrv-u-display-block">Related story</span> <span class="c-title a-font-secondary-medium-s@mobile-max a-font-primary-xs@tablet lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-margin-b-1 u-margin-t-050@tablet lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-color-brand-primary:hover">Joe Jonas Shared a Very Cryptic Message Amid His Contentious Split From Sophie Turner</span></a></p><p>We have to admit that the pair makes sense as a match. While Tyrion is the character most frequently praised for his wise words, Sansa has slowly been taking over that role, with Arya calling her “the smartest person [she] knows,” and both Littlefinger and Jon Snow being captivated by her newfound savvy. And Tyrion is in dire need of some clear-headed advice at the moment, as his relationships to the other Lannister siblings continue to complicate his role as Dany’s Hand of the Queen.</p><p>We cannot say, however, that this was a wholly romantic moment between the two. Sansa remarks that they can do “nothing” to help against the army of the undead above, and Tyrion admires the sentiment: “Maybe we should have stayed married,” he quips. But given both of their certainty that they’ll die in the coming moments — particularly after the crypt’s skeletons are re-animated and attacking — it seems more likely that this is a moment of connection between two people who can see the good in one another. Tyrion kissing Sansa’s hand is certainly poignant, but more so because they’re taking courage from each other in that moment. If and when Sansa gets her love story, we think the moment will be grander.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jp6lrZ2iqa6qusyepa1nkafBqq%2FLnqpoamBogXmEmGirsqqZpLtuuMCnpaKrpJq%2Fbr%2FAp6qaZaOprrO3jKGYp5xdoLa0v4ygmKadXaSzbsDHq6annaNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
