As of early 2016, it is reported to be $20 million, gained mostly from his career in playing basketball.</p><h3>Paul George Net Worth $20 Million</h3><p>Born in Palmdale, California, George came from a family of athletes. His older sisters are both sportswomen, Teiosha plays basketball at Pepperdine and Portala plays volleyball at CSU-San Bernardino. Because of his sister’s influence, George also grew up playing sports. Teiosha would play basketball with him in their neighbourhood, but he was not able to play with any formal teams until he entered Pete Knight High School, but during his time their George showed great potential and started winning awards with and for his team. His coach would even put him in the first five even though he wasn’t a senior yet. In his last season in high school, they won the Golden League championship and he bagged the MVP award as well.</p><p>Although George ended his high school years with great numbers, his school was not big with college recruiters. Eventually Santa Clara University offered him a basketball scholarship, but he still wanted to consider other schools. Pepperdine University also became an option because of her sister’s influence, but he changed his mind when the coach who he preferred quit and finally made his choice and grabbed the offer from California State University-Fresno.</p><p>George, performed exceptionally well during his stay in Fresno State. He was tagged as his team’s best free throw shooter in the history of their school, and was among the top 20 sophomore shooters in the NCAA. Because of his feat early in his college years, even though he was just a sophomore, in 2010 he was included to the NBA Draft and became the highest draft pick in the history of his school. He decided to forego his remaining two years in college and signed a contract with the Indiana Pacers. This big step in his career catapulted him into the spotlight and his contract offer of $3.9 million for two years started his net worth.</p><p>Being consistent with his performance, George has garnered recognitions in the NBA such as being included in the NBA All-Star game three times. He was also named NBA’s Most Improved Player in 2013, and was included in the United States national team in 2014, which competed in the FIBA Basketball World Cup in Spain, but a serious broken leg kept him out of the game for several months.. All of his achievement helped in his popularity though, and led him to have an extension of contract with his team in 2014, increasing his net worth.</p><p>Today, George is still with the Indiana Pacers. Other than basketball he also volunteers for “G2 Zone” along with team mate George Hill. It is a special group of fans at Bankers Life Fieldhouse where they help fans garner some free season tickets.</p><p>In terms of his personal life, George is currently dating girlfriend Destiny Marie.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=9.3148148148148><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Paul George</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$20 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$15.9 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>Maj 2, 1990</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Palmdale, California</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6' 8" (2.03 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>99.79</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Profession</td><td>American professional basketball player</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Education</td><td>Pete Knight High School, California State University, Fresno (2008 - 2010)</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Olivia George</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Paulette Ann George, Paul George Sr.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Siblings</td><td>Teiosha George, Portala George</td></tr><tr readability=0.41025641025641><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/ygtrece</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.4><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/Yg_Trece</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.4390243902439><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.instagram.com/ygtrece</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm6310993</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Awards</td><td>NBA Most Improved Player Award (2013), NBA All-Defensive Team (2014)</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=1><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Professional basketball player with the Indiana Pacers beginning in 2010.</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Mike & Mike</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Indiana Pacers</td></tr><tr><td>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - NBA</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Archive Footage <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqmYrqRdnLKwvsaeZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
