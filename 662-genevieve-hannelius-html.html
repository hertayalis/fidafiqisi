Her parents, Paul and Kathy Hannelius relocated to Falmouth, Maine where they settled through her childhood. This was a good decision since it is in Maine that her love for acting started. She would practice in the Children’s Theatre of Maine and before long she was in a number of plays including ‘Rescue in the summer ‘. In 2008, she travelled to Los Angeles where she spent three months auditioning for roles.</p><p>Her auditions were a success so her parents, in a bid to promote her talents to Hollywood, decided to relocate to Los Angeles.

This became the very first step in her acting journey.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/world-celebs.com/public/media/resize/800x-/2019/6/14/g-hannelius-bio-net-worth-facts.jpg><p>She landed a role in the sitcom Surviving Suburbia starring Bob Saget.
