Unfortunately, it was for some pretty horrifying reasons. The artist was at the Nitro Circus event in California on Sunday. He tried to do their mega-ramp while on some sort of tricycle.

Appreciate everyone’s concerns, walked out the hospital with a few stitches! Alhumdullilah!" he wrote. The artist looked a bit worse for wear considering one of his eyes was almost shut. Furthermore, the gash on his abdomen looked pretty gnarly. Regardless, he seems to be doing fine despite the height of the fall.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-artist-responds>The Artist Responds</h2></span><p>Hopefully, JELEEL! takes a bit of a break from being a daredevil.
