Keep scrolling to see for yourself.</p><h2 id=h-matt-klotz data-injectable=false>Matt Klotz</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/4CC2590D-B09F-4D43-8983-CD7E942CF4F1.jpeg><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=271 data-injectable=false>According to the longtime host, “Matt’s biggest strength is his social game. Pretty much everyone loves him,” and we seriously could not agree more. After all, Felicia called him “the all-American guy that everybody loved” upon her eviction!</p><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=true>If that does not prove that he is well-liked within the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">jury house</a>, we don’t know what does, but nonetheless, he still has a few weaknesses that might make it hard to win Big Brother 25.</p><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=213 data-injectable=false>“His weakness is trusting Jag too much and following what Jag wants. Plus, his number of wins is the lowest of the final three,” Julie continued before diving into Jag’s strengths and weaknesses.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jag Bains</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Jag-Bains-Big-Brother.png><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=155 data-injectable=false>Julie had some extremely positive things to say about Jag, praising his impressive resume that has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">broken some of the hit competition show’s records</a>.</p><p data-characters=128 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>“His strength is his resume! 7 POV wins? He broke a new record,” she gushed before diving into his biggest weakness.</p><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=552 data-injectable=true>The longtime Big Brother host continued passionately, “His weakness is that people in the jury may have respect for his comp skills, but do they, by and large, feel deep love or affection for him? Some are angry with him because they could never trust him.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Bowie Jane</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bowie-Jane.png><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>Last but certainly not least, definitely don’t count Bowie Jane out! Several&nbsp;Big Brother&nbsp;superfans think <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she has what it takes to bring home the $750,000 cash prize</a>.</p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false>“Her strength is her 3 HOH wins, and they were all recent, so they are fresh in the minds of the jurors,” Julie gushed, in addition to the fact that she has never touched the block — how impressive is that?</p><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=444 data-injectable=true>On the other hand, “Her weakness is that she has no bonds with any of the jurors. No one there is close with her,” the longtime host continued, posing a problem that may cause her to fall short come finale night.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 data-characters=273 data-current-count=273 data-injectable=false>While it would be a joy to see any of the three remaining houseguests win&nbsp;Big Brother 25, who will take home the $750,000 cash prize in the end?&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tune into CBS or Paramount Plus this Thursday (Nov. 9) to see for yourself</a>&nbsp;— it will surely be a season finale to remember!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yjtcZmmaunpJ2ys3nHqKqtZZqquaqxjJyfnqZdorywutWeqmagmZy1rbXGoausZaSdsm6%2F06ucp5%2BkncBurc2dZLCdkaC7pr%2FSnqpmp5Zis6q6wKVkbGWSl392eceorKydl6qytMDSZqSarKRit6KzjJqlnWWSpMSqsYyjmKedXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
