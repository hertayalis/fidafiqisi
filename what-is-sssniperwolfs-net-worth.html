The vast majority of the platform’s top creators are male, leading to an often bare number of popular female stars among the app’s high-earners. Among those rare women to tackle the task of becoming a known presence on YouTube is Alia Marie “Lia” Shelesh, a popular content creator who’s carved out a comfortable niche among the platform’s favorite stars.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=328 data-current-count=328 data-injectable=false>Shelesh, who typically goes by her username, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>SSSniperWolf</strong></a>, has been slowly building her following for years. Her YouTube channel, which first launched in early 2013, has since rocketed in popularity. The page now boasts more than 34 million subscribers, and videos on her page have earned upwards of 23 million views in total.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=672 data-current-count=1000 data-injectable=true>SSSniperWolf’s typical uploads vary widely. She is known in the gaming community for her streaming uploads, which typically see her enjoying a bout of Minecraft, Fortnite: Battle Royale, Call of Duty or Among Us, but is known more widely on YouTube for her contributions to the platform’s humorous content. The majority of her videos see SSSniperWolf sharing viral stories with commentary, attempting life hacks, and simply uploading vlogs about her day-to-day life. She has also drummed up a solid following through her cosplaying, videos of which see her interpretation of numerous popular characters including Mario, DC’s Poison Ivy, and Bulma from Dragon Ball Z.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sssniperwolf-s-net-worth data-injectable=false>SSSniperWolf’s net worth</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=496 data-current-count=796 data-injectable=true>SSSniperWolf puts more time into her channel than many YouTube creators, as evidenced by her frequent uploads. While many creators upload fresh content every few days, a typical week sees SSSniperWolf putting out new videos almost daily. This hard work pays off in YouTube ad revenue, particularly considering SSSniperWolf’s consistent view count. Her typical daily upload gets a minimum of 1 million views, with many of her more popular videos rocketing to view counts in the tens of millions.</p><p data-characters=595 data-current-count=595 data-injectable=false>With all the ad revenue those consistent uploads bring in, SSSniperWolf makes an enviable living on YouTube. Thanks to her high number of monthly views, paired with merch sales and affiliates, the British-American YouTuber has a net worth of $16 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. That number equals out to more than a million a year in earnings since SSSniperWolf started her YouTube channel, which is impressive by any estimation. Once you add in the fact that she is still in her late 20s, and her content isn’t slowing down at all, that number is all but guaranteed to keep rising.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeppMK1wcGeZrCgkal6qr%2BMrKqsppmlsrPDzqWdrGWemsFuw86rq6Fn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
