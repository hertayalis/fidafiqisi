She’s been working<br>it for a half hour or so, when the far-off look on her face disappears and her self-proclaimed inability to sit still takes over.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I think we’ve got it,” she announces, hopping off her perch and heading to wardrobe, the scent of teen spirit wafting in her wake as everyone starts moving on to the next frame.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: 11 Questions with Eleven</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not many 13-year-olds get away with literally calling the shots in a room full of New York City fashion creatives, but confidence is not something the fledgling star lacks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brown grew up as the third of four children in the southern English coastal town of Bournemouth, where her parents realized early on that she was a natural-born performer. While her siblings favored cartoons, Brown opted for musicals and watched <i>America’s Next Top Model</i> on repeat. She started auditioning for commercials at age 8 and eventually landed bit roles on shows like <i>Modern Family</i> and <i>Grey’s Anatomy</i>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Brown in a Dior Haute Couture gown, with a Delfina Delettrez ring, and The Row ballet flats. Photographed by Anthony Maule.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her big break came last year when she bounded onto the scene in Netflix’s ’80s-inspired sci-fi hit, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1><i>Stranger Things</i></a>, in which she holds her own against Matthew Modine and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Winona Ryder</a> as Eleven, a wunderkind with psychokinetic abilities who can throw grown men into walls with her distinctive steely stare. She’s already nabbed a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>SAG Award</a> for her role as part of the ensemble cast, and the series received 18 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Emmy</a> nominations for its first run, including outstanding supporting actress in a drama series for Brown.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Given that Season 1 ended with her character presumably trapped in the underworld called the Upside Down, questions have persisted about her return. Fear not: Brown confirms over a plate of French fries that she will be back and is more excited than ever, in part because she has more than the 40 or so lines she had last year. “It’s a lot darker and more emotional and emotionally challenging for me, 10 times more than the first season,” she says. “Everything is explained.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Brown in a Calvin Klein T-shirt and Calvin Klein by Appointment skirt with a Nataf Joaillerie ring. Photographed by Anthony Maule.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brown also just wrapped her first feature film, <i>Godzilla: King of the Monsters,</i> in which she plays the lead opposite Vera Farmiga and Kyle Chandler. She loved the experience, but not so much the big-screen pacing. “I had the time of my life, but it’s very different,” she says. “The other day we did 75 takes for one scene, and for <i>Stranger Things </i>we sometimes do it all in one take, so it’s very interesting.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Along with her experience, her social circle is also broadening. She’s done solo TV appearances on <i>Ellen</i> and <i>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,</i> had powwows with the likes of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Meryl Streep</a> and Barack Obama (both of whom she calls “very sweet”), and even gone from fangirl to friend of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Miley Cyrus</a>. “We text and FaceTime often,” says Brown. “She’s fabulous.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Brown in a Giambattista Valli Haute Couture dress and top with Wolford tights. Photographed by Anthony Maule.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now Brown is getting used to having her own admirers. “I can’t walk down a street or outside this hotel without somebody asking for a picture,” she says. “But there’s also the fact that I kind of asked for it, you know? I can’t blame it on my fans. I will never say no unless I’m in an airport and need to catch a flight or I’m at dinner with my family, because that’s just quality time. But other than that, no, I’m fine with the fame. I accept it. All I want to do is model, act, and sing, so if fame comes with that, then so be it.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A triple threat if there ever was one, she says she’s not quite ready for Broadway but enjoys honing those <i>ANTM</i> skills. “Modeling is very close to my heart,” she says. “I feel like just taking pictures is amazing. You’ll feel if you did a good job in that shoot—or if you feel like you haven’t, then you haven’t. But some pictures turn out to be iconic, and it means so much.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Brown in a Chanel Haute Couture dress and boots with Wolford tights and a Hirotaka ear cuff. Photographed by Anthony Maule.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not surprisingly, the fashion world loves her right back. (A young, bubbly pixie on the rise who can wear clothes well? What’s not to love?) She has been courted by brands such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Coach</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Louis Vuitton</a> and is currently the face of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Converse</a>. This past January she appeared in the first campaign for Calvin Klein’s couture line, By Appointment, under the watchful eye of new chief creative officer Raf Simons, one of the industry’s most revered designers. She was playing Monopoly with her family in a cabin in the woods when her agent called to tell her she got the gig. When asked if she knew of Simons’s work beforehand, Brown’s reply is the verbal equivalent of an eye roll: “Of course. I mean, come on.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Off duty, she favors pieces from Topshop and her Converse kicks, but for any professional appearances the selection process isn’t as casual. She works with a stylist to find “age-appropriate” looks that are then run by an extensive list of guardians. “Everything I wear has to go through every person on my team,” she says. “It has to go through my mum first. If she approves, it’ll go to my agents, and then, obviously, the last stop is my dad—and if he doesn’t like it, then I’m not wearing it. It’s as simple as that.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Brown in a Calvin Klein by Appointment skirt with varsity letters, a Calvin Klein T-shirt, and a Hirotaka ear cuff. Photographed by Anthony Maule.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her steady references to her family are a charming reminder that she’s still a kid, albeit one with an outsize future. “You know, I’m just a 13-year-old like any other 13-year-old, so I just plan on living my life and take it step-by-step. Hopefully, in five years’ time I will be in college. No, let’s say eight years … unless I get a really good movie. Then it’s, ‘See ya, college!’ ”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Brown in a Rodarte blouse, skirt, and belt with Falke tights and The Row mules.
