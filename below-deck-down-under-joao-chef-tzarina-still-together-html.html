Of course, all this went down even after Mace-Ralph said Franco hurt one of her friends so she was a little <a href=#>spicy toward him when he came on board</a>. But the ice melted pretty quickly for Mace-Ralph, especially when <a href=#>deckhand Culver Bradbury</a> suddenly became interested in new stew Jaimee Neale.</p><p id=par-3_19>With only a few Below Deck Down Under episodes left, why didn’t João Franco and Tzarina Mace-Ralph stay together?</p><h2 id=h-does-joao-s-hook-up-with-margot-sisson-destroy-any-future-with-chef-tzarina>Does João’s hook-up with Margot Sisson destroy any future with Chef Tzarina?</h2><p id=par-4_60>Production “snuck in” a clip of what appears to be Franco and stew Margot Sisson in a liplock. The clip was so fast it was hard to confirm that it was Franco and Sisson making out. Also, there was no context behind the moment. Sometimes the yachties play a truth or dare kissing game, which could be the case.</p><p id=par-5_55>If the makeout session is true, it would certainly destroy the crew dynamic. Mace-Ralph already felt stabbed in the back when Neale and Bradbury hooked up. Mace-Ralph and Bradbury flirted massively before Franco and Neale arrived on board. But everything changed when Neale came on board. Bradbury kissed Neale during her first crew outing.</p><p id=par-6_60>So now that Franco and Mace-Ralph have hooked up, what would a kiss with Sisson do to their romance? One clue that perhaps Franco and Sisson hooked up is that Franco and Mace-Ralph don’t follow each other on Instagram. However, there’s no bad blood between Mace-Ralph and Sisson. Mace-Ralph shared an airport meetup she had with Sisson on Instagram.</p><p id=par-7_27>“Got you back and I don’t ever want to let you go again.” Mace-Ralph captioned a video along with the hashtag bestie and she tagged Sisson.</p><h2 id=h-joao-and-chef-tzarina-are-still-not-together-he-s-with-someone-new>João and Chef Tzarina are still not together – he’s with someone new</h2><p id=par-8_28>Below Deck Down Under Season 2 was filmed more than a year ago and Franco and Mace-Ralph seemed to have moved on with other people and adventures.</p><p id=par-9_32>For her part, it doesn’t appear that Mace-Ralph is dating anyone –&nbsp;at least she’s keeping any romance private. Her Instagram is filled with yachting adventures and (of course) culinary eye candy.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" id=emb-1></figure><p id=par-10_46>Franco has been busy racking up new certifications but also seemed to be seeing someone new. He’s posted photos with a woman named Domi Tiesi for a little less than a year. The most recent photo she posted alongside Franco was in late August.</p><p id=par-11_57>Franco’s girlfriend appears to also be a yachtie and the couple has worked together. “16-hour passages between Italy and Montenegro made easy with this lady’s company,” he captioned a photo on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>. “Took the vessel for her maiden voyage!! We could have done it in 9 hours but we took it easy. Let the season begin!”</p><p id=par-12_25>Only a few episodes of Below Deck Down Under Season 2 remain. Below Deck Down Under is on Monday at 8 p.m. on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvprjOsGSdnZOgeqW71qdkrqaUmr9uts6apmabmJqzbsDZmqmippFiwLW1y6VkraeXmsGpsdFnn62lnGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
