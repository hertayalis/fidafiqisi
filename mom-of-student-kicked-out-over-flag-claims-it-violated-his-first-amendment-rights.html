It has to be a significant disruption to the educational mission of the school in order for the school to regulate the student’s speech,” said Zansberg, who is not representing the family.</p><p>“And I’m deeply skeptical that that’s true here,” he added.</p><p>A school administrator told Rodriguez that her son could not display the patch because of the flag’s “origins with slavery and the slave trade,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">video of a meeting</a> between them shows.</p><p>The mom argued the Gadsden flag’s origins can actually be traced to the Revolutionary War and not slavery — but the school also claimed the seventh-grader violated dress code policy with other patches, including some displaying firearms.</p><p>Rodriguez praised her son for standing up for his beliefs and protecting his rights.</p><p>“I’m proud that he just chose the hard route,” she said of the “very stressful” experience.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The school said the seventh-grader had other patches depicting semi-automatic weapons. <span class=credit>Twitter / @cboyack</span></figure><p>The Vanguard School cited the national media coverage of the story in a statement but noted that “the story is incomplete.”</p><p>“The patch in question was part of half a dozen other patches of semi-automatic weapons. The student has removed the semi-automatic patches,” it said.</p><p>“As a school district, we will continue to ensure all students and employees can learn and work in a safe and nurturing environment. The student returned to class without incident after removing the patches of semi-automatic weapons from the backpack,” the school added.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The Gadsden flag was first used by the US’s first naval commander-in-chief as a personal ensign during the American Revolution, according to Britannica. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>Democratic Gov. Jared Polis defended Jaiden.</p><p>“The Gadsden flag is a proud symbol of the American Revolution and an iconic warning to Britain or any government not to violate the liberties of Americans,” Polis tweeted in response to the video.</p><p>“It appears on popular American medallions and challenge coins through today and Ben Franklin also adopted it to symbolize the union of the 13 colonies. It’s a great teaching moment for a history lesson!” he added.</p><p>The flag was first used by Commodore Esek Hopkins, the country’s first naval commander-in-chief, as a personal ensign during the American Revolution, according to Britannica.</p><p>It has been adopted by the conservative Tea Party movement and has become increasingly associated with right-wing politics.</p><p>In 2016, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled that the flag itself is not a racist symbol but is “sometimes interpreted to convey racially tinged messages in some contexts” while investigating a US Postal Service employee complaint about a co-worker wearing a hat with the flag.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3FmbGhforyuec6fZKyspZmyr8CMpKCco5WZerDB02amr52iYrOtrcZmmqWZmaLAbrXTZq2ip5yWwaawjKGgrGWWnr%2B0wIyapJ6mlKKyr8CMq6CgoKSofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
