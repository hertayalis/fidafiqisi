Actually it was filmed two weeks ago. So I‚Äôm officially out of self quarantine and back to being dad. After being Edge for WrestleMania 36.</p><p>For the first time in a singles match in 9 years. Against, in my opinion, the most naturally talented person in the industry in&nbsp;@randyorton&nbsp;I will always be proud of what we accomplished with some strange circumstances. I have a feeling we haven‚Äôt seen the last of each other. And for that I‚Äôm strangely thankful. He pulled me to a 40 minute fight after being retired for 9 years.</p><p>Wasn‚Äôt sure I had that in me. Now I know. He pushed me. For all of you, hopefully you watched WrestleMania and were able to get lost in it and try to forget about our current reality, even if only for a few hours. I‚Äôd also like to thank EVERYONE for the outpouring of positivity for the&nbsp;@wwe&nbsp;24 documentary, The Second Mountain. Also, thank you to the ENTIRE team it took to support me and make all of this happen. I‚Äôll get to you all on separate postsüòâ It‚Äôs humbling. Lastly, stay safe everyone.</p><p>Edge will be back on WWE television. <a href=#>He inked deal for seven more matches over the next three years. </a>His WWE appearances won‚Äôt happen often, but Edge will return once the time nears for him to pick his next destination in WWE. For now, it seems like he‚Äôs going back home to Ruby, Lyric, and Beth Phoenix.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
