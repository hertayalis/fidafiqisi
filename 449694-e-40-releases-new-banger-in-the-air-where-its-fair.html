In addition to songs like <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"Too Big"</a> from this year with Mount Westmore, he's just dropped "In The Air Where It's Fair" with Cousin Fik. The Bay legend dominated the track with his trademark dizzying rhymes and off-beat flows, and also released a music video.</p><p>David Becker/Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Firstly, the instrumental has its claps and bass on point, two of the most important elements of a Cali banger. Like others of its kind, it's a minimal beat that goes a long way in the bar-filled mix. There are some arpeggiating keys, floating up and down, that make the track almost spacey or woozy. However, the distorted synth hits and simple bass bring the track back to Earth.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While this may not be a revolutionary sound for E-40, it's been a while since it's dominated hip-hop. Sure, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kendrick Lamar</a> is the greatest rapper of the moment, but cities like Atlanta, Miami, and Detroit are ripe with sonic inspiration in the game. Therefore, the West Coast is defending its roots and its legends, and E-40 is among the legends leading the charge. He recently appeared on the<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> Wakanda Forever soundtrack</a> alongside bilingual West Coast MC Snow Tha Product. Also, his album with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ice Cube</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Snoop Dogg</a>, and Too $hort under the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Mount Westmore</a> moniker on December 9th.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">One of E-40's hallmarks is his lyricism and idiosyncratic pen game. His flows fall over the beat, speed up and slow down unexpectedly, and house a compelling stream of consciousness. Moreover, he's not treading new lyrical material on the track, just being a real G and repping his city. Still, E-40 includes some funny lines, comparisons, and references in here. "This one of the most requested slappers on Shazam," "I got bars, I passed the bar exam," and "crown me like a root canal" were some standouts.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, guest Cousin Fik delivers some subtle but effective background vocals in the chorus to give it more dynamism. His voice isn't super notable on the track, yet the chorus sounds fuller and with more space in the mix.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Check out E-40's newest track on your preferred streaming service.

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdkaYZ3hZNmnGZsYGK%2FprjEmqqeq12jsrh5wZqloJ2iYravedOhnGaZmad6uLTEq5xmoaSoeqetyKs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
