It’s budget-friendly, easy to make, and comforting in the way that only pasta with red sauce can be. Though this lentil pasta recipe is full of Italian flavors (marinara! balsamic! Parmesan!), it’s not a take on any specific Italian pasta dish. Rather, it’s something I love to cook when I want a hearty, flavorful pasta dinner, but I don’t&nbsp;want to go to the store or spend hours in the kitchen. This lentil pasta recipe comes together with basic pantry ingredients, and you can have it on the…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Homemade tomato soup is like a hug in a bowl, which, when the weather is as gray as it has been here lately, is exactly what I need. This tomato soup recipe is a cold weather staple in our house. It couldn’t be simpler to make, and the ingredients are largely pantry basics that I always keep on hand. But more importantly, this tomato soup is creamy, comforting, and full of rich flavor. The tomatoes make it tangy, balsamic vinegar adds sweetness, and red pepper flakes give it a warming kick of heat. You could serve it on its own,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If you’re wondering how to make a grilled cheese sandwich, Jack’s your guy. He makes one so often that we have a dedicated grilled cheese pan in our kitchen. It’s seen a million grilled cheese experiments in its day–mayo on the bread, or softened butter? American cheese or Swiss?–all of which have helped him work out what, in our opinion, is THE BEST grilled cheese recipe. It’s incredibly simple, but it yields an undeniably crave-able sandwich. This grilled cheese is crisp and golden on the outside and deliciously melty in the middle (see that cheese pull up there?!). Tomato soup…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This cauliflower fried rice recipe is one of the best meals I’ve eaten recently. It just checks all my boxes! It’s quick and easy to make, it’s chock-full of veggies, and, most importantly, it’s seriously PACKED with flavor. If you’re still a cauliflower rice skeptic, it’s time to give it a chance! I’m willing to bet that this recipe will make you love it. So, what exactly makes this cauliflower fried rice so flavorful? Well, instead of modeling it off a Chinese-style fried rice, I took inspiration from Korean kimchi fried rice and used chopped kimchi to load this dish…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If you’re used to topping your morning oats with nut butter and fresh fruit, the concept of savory oatmeal might sound strange. But give it a chance, and I think you’ll be surprised. Oats (which, after all, are a whole grain like farro, brown rice, wheat berries, or any other) pair perfectly with savory fixings like avocado, sautéed greens, and soft boiled eggs. These hearty toppings make this savory oatmeal recipe a satisfying and nutritious breakfast, and they also carry oats beyond the breakfast zone, transforming them into a delicious option for a quick dinner or lunch. So even if…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This kale soup recipe is exactly what I’m craving these days: comfort food + tons of veggies, all rolled into one. Its creamy broth (which, by the way, is thickened with blended white beans, not heavy cream) is swimming with tender kale and aromatics like onions, carrots, and celery. Rosemary and thyme add piney flavor, and a squeeze of lemon juice gives it the perfect bright finish. If you’re looking for a dish that is equal parts cozy, healthy, and delicious, look no further. This kale soup is it!

It’s easy to put together (no rolling required!), but it still captures all the tastes and textures I crave in a good veggie sushi roll. Creamy avocado plays off sticky seasoned rice, which in turn contrasts with crisp, cooling cucumbers and crackly nori. I add ripe mango for a hit of sweetness, baked tofu for protein, and big drizzles of spicy mayo for richness and heat. I like to prep the components ahead of time and enjoy this sushi bowl for…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Do you ever have nights when you just don’t know what to make for dinner?

Below, you’ll find 60 healthy dinner recipes that are perfect for busy weeknights. Each one is quick and easy to make, but it still packs a punch of flavor.

This veggie “roast” might be my all-time favorite dish to make for a dinner party or a holiday meal. It’s simple (the oven does most of the work for you!), it can pass as a main dish for some folks and as a side for others, and it looks so impressive at the center of the table. And this whole roasted cauliflower recipe doesn’t disappoint on taste either. Thanks to a long, two-part roast, it’s beautifully browned on the outside and meltingly tender to its core. I’ve included instructions for roasting it plain in…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Have you tried this baked ziti recipe?! It’s a fan favorite on the blog, and it’s one of our family favorites as well. If you have yet to make it, I hope you will soon. This easy baked ziti is a perfect no-fuss recipe for feeding a crowd, and the combo of marinara sauce, pasta, and three (yes, three!) types of cheese is so comforting. This baked ziti recipe is my veggie spin on the version I grew up eating. Reliably present at every potluck or party I attended, it was my favorite comfort food. I loved the jumbles of…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Broccoli cheddar soup is one of Jack’s favorite foods. Ask him about the version at Panera Bread, and he’ll go on and on about its creamy texture and rich, tangy, cheesy flavor. He never expected me to develop a broccoli cheddar soup recipe at home (unless you count this vegan twist), but with the holidays right around the corner, I thought it would be fun to surprise him with one. So, on a gray, chilly day last weekend, when we were both craving comfort food, I finally made him this broccoli cheddar soup recipe.
