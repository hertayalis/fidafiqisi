Singer raved to ET after Dodd and Leventhal's engagement&nbsp;last November.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"Kelly stayed with me, she had just broken up with her boyfriend, and I said, 'Come stay with me.' She said, 'Are you sure?' I said, 'Of course! I have this huge house. Come, come, come,'" she continued. "She stayed with me for eight days. She's younger than me, said I have more energy than her. I dragged her from one party to another, and the one party she didn't want to go to because, 'Oh, it's too far…' [and] that's where she met Rick and fell in love! So, there you go. Yes, I'm very happy for her."</span></p><p><span>Dodd was&nbsp;previously married to Michael Dodd, with whom she&nbsp;shares a daughter, Jolie. Leventhal was married to professional poker player Beth Shak; they divorced in 2017 after less than a year of marriage. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>See more on Dodd in the video below.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>RELATED CONTENT:&nbsp;</span></strong></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>TV</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>'RHOC's Kelly Dodd Reacts to Tamra Judge Saying She Needs to Be Fired</span></h3></a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>TV</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>'RHOC's Kelly Dodd Says She and Vicki Gunvalson Have Made Up (Exclusive)</span></h3></a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>TV</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>Kelly Dodd Wants to Leave 'RHOC' for 'RHONY' and Her Co-Stars Have Thoughts About It (Exclusive)</span></h3></a><p class=label>Video</p><a class=title href=#>Why Kelly Dodd Wants to Leave 'RHOC' for 'RHONY' (Exclusive)</a>Related Photos<a href=# aria-label="Celebrity Weddings of 2020"><span class=slidecount>26 Photos</span></a><a href=# aria-label="Celebrity Weddings of 2020"><span>Celebrity Weddings of 2020</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7psDOp6OippVjsLC5jqScpaSpYrGwsMNmmKecXae2pLeMpZyvnZ6ptaK4jK2gnmWknbJut82oq2ahnmK7orzAZpqeqpWivK%2FFjGpsbWxobg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
