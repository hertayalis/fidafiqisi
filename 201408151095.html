With two older sisters, he is the baby of the family.</p><p id=eMuwlkznhi data-wc=27>&nbsp;He could have had a career on the sports field as he excelled at rugby and played for the Belfast Harlequins, but decided to pursue acting instead.&nbsp;</p><p id=eHUIU-IEfF data-wc=54>When he was 16, his childhood was devastated by the death of his mother from pancreatic cancer. Then, a year later four friends from his grammar school Methodist College in Belfast died in a car crash.

I am always going to fight against that."</p><p id=eo8IlCCWlD data-wc=17>Jamie also had a brief flirtation with a music career in the folk band Sons of Jim.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/661743955eca-jamie-dornan-wife-amelia-d.jpg><h2>Jamie Dornan's acting career</h2><p id=ecVvzhf8W4 data-wc=45>Jamie landed a role in Sofia Coppola's 2006 film Marie Antoinette&nbsp;opposite Kirsten Dunst, and played serial killer Paul Spector in controversial BBC Two drama The Fall.&nbsp;He starred opposite Gillian Anderson and the show was so successful it was commissioned for a second series.</p><p id=ex8L21HQdL data-wc=41>His wife was heavily pregnant when Jamie received a 2am call from LA to confirm that he'd bagged the lead in Fifty Shades of Grey, so he merely snuck into bed quietly to avoid waking her and went to sleep himself.&nbsp;</p><p id=eOTdajeqH8U data-wc=45>The movie was a box office hit, despite being panned by critics, and the star reprised his role in the second and third installments of the Fifty Shades film franchise.
