The Athlon was destined to become just as affordable as the older Super7 processors were, without the headaches and the poor FPU performance that characterized its predecessors.</span></p><p><span>In spite of this clear move away from the Socket that had carried AMD for quite a while, the company had on display, in one corner of their suite, a brand new Super7 processor. However the K6-2+ wasn't running in the same old desktop Super7 boards we were used to seeing, rather it was in a notebook.</span></p><p><span>With the first Athlons with power requirements in the 50 - 54W range (0.25-micron K7 core), there was no way that AMD could maintain a successful mobile CPU line based on the Athlon core in its current form. Even using the 0.18-micron Athlons wasn't a possibility because their power consumption was still in the 30 - 48W range.</span></p><p><span>In order to fill this void in their product line, they took their previous generation K6-III, which was fairly successful in areas that did not require heavy floating point computations, and changed it around a bit in order to better suit the needs of the mobile market.</span></p><p><span>If you'll recall, upon its introduction, the 0.25-micron K6-III was essentially based on the K6-2 core with the addition of a full-speed 256KB L2 cache on-die. This would later be a part of what AMD called their TriLevel Cache design which consisted of the on-die L1 and L2 caches and an optional on-board L3 cache (up to 1MB).</span></p><p><span><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/reviews/mobile/amd/powernow/chip.gif width=300 height=219 align=right style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>The K6-2+ makes use of a smaller 0.18-micron fabrication process, thus decreasing power consumption and heat production as well as increasing the number of chips AMD could produce per wafer at their plants. The addition of the '+' to the end of the K6-2 name indicates the use of AMD's 0.18-micron fabrication process, the same holds true for the K6-III+.</span></p><p><span>All '+' chips including the K6-2+ feature the same Enhanced 3DNow! instructions that were originally introduced with the Athlon processors last August.</span></p><p><span>The K6-2+'s TriLevel cache design deviates from the original K6-III's implementation in that it features a 128KB 4-way set associative on-die L2 cache, rather than a 256KB cache. The CPU still features the same 64KB 2-way set associative L1 cache as its predecessors, and still allows for up to a 1MB external, on-board L3 cache. However it is highly unlikely that you'll see any mobile configurations with any L3 cache, much less 1MB, simply because of space constraints.</span></p><p><span>The K6-2+ still operates on the same 100MHz FSB and 100MHz memory bus, but thanks to the processor's on-die L2 cache, the 100MHz FSB isn't the limitation it used to be with the first desktop K6-2s.</span></p><p><span>However, quite possibly the most important feature of the K6-2+ (and the K6-III+) is its support for a little feature AMD likes to call PowerNow! In fact, the K6-2+'s PowerNow! support is what makes the processor an attractive option for mobile users.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZINzfI5r</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
